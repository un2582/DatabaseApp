# DatabaseApp
This is an app for storing data into a data base. You have the option of storing its title, ispn, author, and the year in which it was published or it could be the year in which you read the data.
There's three files: frontend.py, backend.py, and frontend.exe. The executable is standalone and can be run by itself. Or you can run the script frontend.py in the command line, but that requires also having backend.py in the same directory.
